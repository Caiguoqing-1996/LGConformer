**LGConformer: A Cross-Scale Spatiotemporal Model for Robust Cross-Session EEG Decoding**

This repo provides a preliminary PyTorch implementation of LGConformer â€” a cross-scale spatiotemporal model tailored for robust cross-session EEG decoding, specifically for MI-EEG tasks.

**Code Status:**

**Current content:** Preliminary PyTorch implementation (not full version).

**Full code release:** Scheduled after the corresponding paper is accepted. This is to accommodate potential model/code adjustments needed from future peer review feedback, as the paper is still in the pre-publication stage.
